        <p class="about-content">My Allergy Book is a completely personalized guide to the details of your child's allergies.</p>
        <p class="about-content">Being a parent of a baby/toddler with allergies can be a very scary thing, especially when he/she is temporarily in someone else's care. We make allergy lists and notes and put them with the child's EpiPen, but how well do these notes really communicate the potential dangers and what to do in case of an emergency? Not to mention these paper lists end up getting worn and rendered useless very quickly.</p>
        <p class="about-content">My Allergy Book works to "outfox" these pesky and danergous allergies by providing very specific information about your child's allergies in one location, such name and date of birth, list of allergy related medications and a blurb about there purpose, list of allergies with illustrations, list of safe and loved foods, and sources of specific hidden allergies for your child (for example, sesame seeds as "tahini").</p>
        <p class="about-content">These books are also laminated and will hold up well while you take them everywhere your child goes; in a medical backpack, with your EpiPens, or order one for each individual that your child spends time with.</p>
        <p class="about-content">It's important for children to understand their own allergies as well. Information is presented allongside visuals whenever possible, allowing for it to serve as educational for both adults and children.</p>
